# mazes
Maze-generation and maze-solving written in Rust.  

## Overview.

### Implemented maze-generation algorithms.
* Kruskal

### Implemented maze-solving algorithms.

## Notes.
For understanding and implementing the algorithms, the Python API [mazelib](https://github.com/john-science/mazelib/tree/main) was very helpful. If you are interested how the algorithms work, see the linked github-repository for the provided documentation.
